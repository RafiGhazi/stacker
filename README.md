Inspired By Arcade Game called "Stacker" 

Using  a 32x8 LED matrix module that controlled by MAX7219 and push Button for interfacing with the user.

Schematics and PCB design are available, open the folder if you want to develop it to final design.

there's also wokw integrated visual studio code if you want to use a simulation but i wouldnt recommend to use it since idk why in wokwi it start LED matrix with the top row not the bottom.
